# HARTT
A compiled exe file from https://github.com/NotThat/Benchmark-DirectX9 for personal use and to share it with people. All credits go to NotThat since he's originally the creator of this project I am only a person who compiled it and changed some variables or modified it.

Upon executing the program you will be met with a blackscreen and to begin the test you have to click your mouse1 button aka. left mouse button to activate the timer and wait for the color to change. For the perception one you will have to wait for the black color to have a slight change and react to it quickly as possible.
